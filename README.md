Hi, I'm Aditya Sirish A Yelgundhalli!

I work on securing software supply chains through projects like @in-toto,
@gittuf, and @slsa-framework. I am a senior software engineer at @bloomberg.
I previously received a Ph.D. from New York University's <a
href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Secure Systems Lab</a>,
where I work on securing software supply chains under the guidance of <a
